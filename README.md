There is also a PlayerHistory so you can see the players past punishments and 
the plugin has configurable Time & Message-Layouts which automatically calculate and increase the Punishment-Time for certain reasons.
AdvancedBan provides also a full Message-File so you can change and translate all messages & a detailed config-file with a lot of useful settings.
This is a BungeeCord & Bukkit/Spigot-Plugin in one and it supports MySQL and Local-File-Storage.
